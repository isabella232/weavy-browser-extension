# Weavy Browser Extension

The extension is built for Google Chrome with the extensions API, but is largely compatible with the cross-browser WEB extensions API and will also run in Moxilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

## Minimal Configuration 

You need to enter the url to your Weavy installation to get this boilerplate to work. Open the file helper.js in the src/scripts/ folder and enter the url to Weavy as the value for the _weavyUrl variable.
